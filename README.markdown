[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/abrkn/mtgox.png)](https://travis-ci.org/abrkn/mtgox)

Installation
---

```
npm install hail
```

Usage
---

```javascript
    var hail = require('hail');

    var gox = new hail.MtGox({
        key: 'my api key'
    });

    var snow = new hail.Snow({
        key: 'herp',
        url: 'derp'
    });

    // Only a single issuer is supported
    var ripple = new hail.Ripple({
        account: 'rAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA',
        secret: 'ssd123123123123',
        issuer: 'r123123123'
    });

    var all = [gox, snow, ripple];

    all.forEach(function(exchange) {
        exchange.depth('BTCUSD', function(err, depth) {
            console.log(depth);
        });

        exchange.order({
            market: 'BTCUSD',
            side: 'bid',
            volume: '1'
            price: '500'
        }, function(err, id) {
            console.log('Order #%s placed', id);
        });
    });

```

Tests
---

```
npm test
```

To test the private features (enumerate orders, create orders, cancel orders), you need to create a file named `config.json` in the root of the module (same directory as this file)

```
{
    "mtgox_key": "",
    "mtgox_secret": "",
    "ripple_account": "",
    "ripple_secret": "",
    "ripple_issuer": ""
}
```
